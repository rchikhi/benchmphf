a benchmark tool for the construction of [minimal perfect hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function#Minimal_perfect_hash_function)

wikipedia definitions: A perfect hash function for a set S is a hash function that maps distinct elements in S to a set of integers, with no collisions. A minimal perfect hash function is a perfect hash function that maps n keys to n consecutive integers—usually [0..n−1] or [1..n].

emphf library: https://github.com/ot/emphf

CHD library: http://cmph.sourceforge.net/

phf library: https://github.com/wahern/phf

Sux4j library (from same authors as emphf): https://github.com/vigna/Sux4J

note that Sux4J isn't integrated in the main benchmark code, but a separate script is provided.

the aim of this program is to evaluate the time and memory used by
those MPHF libraries during _construction_ of the structure;
alternatively, when run with the ``-bench`` command line parameter, it evaluates
query time.

minimal perfect hash functions are created over the following input keys:
a random set of 64-bits integers
(however both libraries support more versatile input, e.g. strings)

Requirements
------------

A compiler that supports C++11 features, e.g. GCC >= 4.9.


How to run 
----------

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/rchikhi/benchmphf
    cd benchmphf
    make
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/libcmph/lib
    ./benchmphf [number of keys, default: 100,000,000]



Example output
--------------

    $ ./benchmphf 100000000
    Constructing a MPHF with n=100000000 elements
    initial data allocation    memory [current, maximum (maxRSS)]: [ 765,  765] MB
    
    Construction with 'emphf' library..
    [...]
    
    benchmphf: [vanilla emphf scan] constructed perfect hash for 100000000 keys in 252.833206s
    after emphf construction    memory [current, maximum (maxRSS)]: [ 810, 2804] MB 
    Very rough estimation of memory used by the MPHF constructed by emphf : 45 MB (3.77487 bits per elt)

    Construction with 'phf' library.. 
    benchmphf: [phf] found perfect hash for 100000000 keys in 107.193024s
    after phf construction    memory [current, maximum (maxRSS)]: [ 938, 3515] MB 
    Very rough estimation of memory used by the MPHF constructed by phf : 128 MB (10.7374 bits per elt)

What's interesting here is the time (252 seconds) and peak memory (2804 MB) taken
for constructing the MPHF using emphf, and similarly for phf. Note that peak memory
includes the data size (here, 765 MB). Hence construction space for emphf is around 2804-765=2039 MB.
The estimation of memory taken by the final MPHF (45 MB for emphf) is inaccurate, see below.



Between emphf/phf, which library is better?
----------------------------

Short answer: 
- in terms of API, _phf_'s is easy to include and well-documented.
- in terms of performance, using the right algorithm from _emphf_ (to minimize either run-time or memory usage) is the best option.

Note that _emphf_ actually implements [four complementary algorithms](https://github.com/ot/emphf): _seq_, _scan_, _scan_mmap_, and _HEM_. By default, this benchmark uses the _scan\_mmap_ algo. But this can be changed by tweaking the source code (in main.cpp).

_emphf's scan\_mmap_ is slower than _phf_ but constructs more compact MPHFs, and uses less memory during construction. This is partly because _scan\_mmap_ implements an external memory algorithm, and _phf_ does not. The final MPHFs constructed by _phf_  are relatively larger because the library does not seem to be performing the final compression steps described in the [CHD algorithm](http://cmph.sourceforge.net/chd.html).

However, I found that the _seq_ and the _HEM_ algorithms are faster than _phf_ during construction, and use less memory. For 1 billion 64-bits random integers, construction using _HEM_ takes 770 seconds and 24 GB of memory, whereas  _phf_ takes 3900 seconds and 48 GB of memory.

phf and emphf, except in _scan\_mmap_ mode, require in the order of 30 bytes per element during construction. _scan\_mmap_ is therefore capable of constructing large MPHFs in situations where memory is limited.

Notes
-----

- The program also provides an estimation of the space used by the structure itself,
via measuring deltas in process memory usage, so it will be extremely inaccurate 
for small values of n  (less than tens of millions). Do not report this value 
in any serious experiment; rather, you should carefully estimate the size of the 
objects that represent the MPHF created by each library.


- The code contains many #ifdef's, because it can also be used in conjunction with the GATB-core library.
 See below for compiling with GATB-core. It enables to test the emphf library that has been integrated inside GATB-core.

- There seems to be a bug with the HEM algorithm for tiny MPHF's (in the order of 1000 elements or less).
(terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error')

- In mphf_hem.cpp of emphf/, I'm not sure, but I'm tempted to change "typedef uint32_t node_t" to the uint64_t type.
Will only affect MPHF of more than 2^32 (~4 billion) elements though.



Advanced usage
--------------

This is for GATB-core developers (https://github.com/GATB/gatb-core/).

- Put the gatb-core library in thirdparty/gatb-core/
- Comment the "#define VANILLA_EMPHF" line in main.cpp
- Compile as follows:

    mkdir build && cmake .. && make -j 4 
    bin/benchmphf
